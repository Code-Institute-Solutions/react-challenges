# Getting Started

### In the terminal do:
<code>cd my-app</code>

<code>nvm install 16 && nvm use 16</code>

<code>npm install</code>

### You can then run the project with the command
<code>npm start</code>

### Items to be aware of
Inside the folder named src you will find a file named posts.json. This file will not be used until a challenge later in the content.  

For convenience react comes installed in this template. A package named axios has also been installed as it will be required in a challenge later.
